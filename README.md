# Hubezorgd
Hubezorgd is a modular, event-driven food takeaway API built using Java Spring Boot and RabbitMQ. Initially developed as
an assignment for the backend specialization at the University of Applied Sciences Utrecht (Hogeschool Utrecht, HU), the
project has since been expanded and refactored.
